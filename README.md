# Redux quiz group project

Project Redux Quiz
By Birgit Nehrwein, Darya Lapata, Aschwin Siaila, Jessica Hermansson and Rebecca Philipson

This group project consisted of building a quiz game with Redux toolkit in React. It is a multiple choice quiz with five questions. When the user selects an answer a message will be shown if it was correct or not. We also implemented a progress bar showing how many questions are left to be answered during the game. The quiz also has a start page and a summary page that shows the amount of correct answers.
The goal of this project was to learn about Redux and global state and how to interact with our store using selectors or by dispatching actions.

## The problem

We worked with the project together as a group as well as in pairs and individually (in smaller branches) and the collaboration worked out very well. One of the major challenges we faced was the planning of the project. Since it was our first time working with Redux we needed to take one step at the time and explore the outcome of the new chunks of code before moving to the next task. Therefore it was hard to plan a lot of the work in advance. If we would start all over again we would focus more on the funcionality and less on the styling for the project.

## **ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

- Your quiz should have at least 5 questions. OK! 
- When the user selects an answer, it should show if they were correct or not. - IN PROGRESS
- While going through the quiz, it should show which question you're on, or how many left - for example 'Question 5 / 15' or '10 questions left'. -OK! 
- When the user has answered all the questions, they should get to a summary screen which tells them how many they got correct or incorrect. -OK! 
- You should challenge yourself to make use of redux by making small components which interact with the store - don't just go for one big component.
- Don't forget CSS! Your quiz should be well styled.

## **ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- After selecting an answer, highlight the correct answer if they chose incorrectly.
- Create a visual progress bar showing how many questions are left to be answered. -OK! 
- Use images or videos to make your questions and answers look richer. - REBECKA
- Give a score for correct answers and deduct points for incorrect answers. If the user goes below a certain score, they lose!
- Enrich the summary with information about what questions they got correct and what questions they should practice more
